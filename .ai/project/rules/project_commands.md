This project uses Bun for the TypeScript tooling in the `modpack_creator/` directory.

## Common Scripts

The following `bun run` scripts are available in `modpack_creator/package.json`:

- `bun run dev_full`: Runs the tool with `--full` flag (creates full modpack) and `--no-upload`

- `bun run auto-update`: Runs the auto-update script to check for mod updates

### Building

### Testing
- `bun run test`: Runs all tests using Bun's test runner
- `bun run test_coverage`: Runs tests with coverage reporting

### Code Quality
- `bun run check_all`: Runs type checking and fixes all linting/formatting issues (runs `check_fix` and `typecheck`)
- `bun run check_and_test`: Does all checks and runs tests with coverage. **You should mostly use this script.**
- `bun run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `bun run check`: Checks code with Biome (linting and formatting)
- `bun run check_fix`: Fixes linting and formatting issues automatically
- `bun run format`: Formats code with Biome

## Running Commands

All commands should be run from the `modpack_creator/` directory:
