# Read-Only Rules

Files and folders that AI agents should treat as read-only. These files should NOT be modified unless the user explicitly confirms with human input.

## Rarely Modified Files/Folders

These files and folders are rarely modified because they are already correctly configured and serve as standards for the project. They CAN be modified by explicitly asking the human for confirmation first.

```ignore
package.json
tsconfig.json
biome.json
turbo.json
.env.example
.husky/
.gitea/
.ai/
```

**Rule:** Can be read freely. If modification seems necessary, MUST ask user for explicit confirmation before making changes.

## Never Modify Files/Folders

These files are auto-generated by tools and should NEVER be manually edited:

```ignore
CHANGELOG.md
```
