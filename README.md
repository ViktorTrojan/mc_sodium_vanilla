# Sodium Vanilla

## About

Sodium Vanilla is a client-side modpack that, like "Sodium Plus," adds performance and quality-of-life improvements. Unlike Sodium Plus, it’s automatically updated to the latest Minecraft version.

## Versions

Each Minecraft version has two modpacks: `_safe` and `_full`.

* `_safe`: only includes mods safe for multiplayer servers.
* `_full`: may cause issues on some servers — use with caution.

## No Default Configuration

This modpack does not include any preset configuration files.
That means you can safely update your Minecraft instance without overwriting your current settings.
