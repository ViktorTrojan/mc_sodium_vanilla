# Read-Only Rules

Files and folders that AI agents should treat as read-only. These files should NOT be modified unless the user explicitly confirms with human input.

## Rarely Modified Files/Folders

These files and folders are rarely modified because they are already correctly configured and serve as standards for the project. They CAN be modified by explicitly asking the human for confirmation first.

```ignore
# Project configuration
modpack_creator/package.json
modpack_creator/tsconfig.json
modpack_creator/biome.json
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
.packwizignore

# Modpack configuration
pack.toml
index.toml

# Environment templates
modpack_creator/.env.example

# AI configuration
.ai/
.claude/

# GitHub workflows
.github/
```

**Rule:** Can be read freely. If modification seems necessary, MUST ask user for explicit confirmation before making changes.

## Special Cases

### pack.toml and index.toml
- `pack.toml`: Main packwiz configuration - only modify if changing modpack version or Minecraft version
- `index.toml`: Auto-generated by packwiz - rarely needs manual modification

### modpack_creator/package.json
- Contains scripts, dependencies, and project metadata
- Scripts define available commands - changes here affect the development workflow
- Dependencies should only be added when truly necessary

### Biome and TypeScript configs
- `modpack_creator/biome.json`: Defines linting, formatting, and code style rules
- `modpack_creator/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration
- Changes to these affect the entire codebase's style and type checking

## Never Modify Files/Folders

These files are auto-generated by tools and should NEVER be manually edited:

```ignore
# Lock files
modpack_creator/bun.lock

# TypeScript build info
*.tsbuildinfo
```
